 * entry says what will happen at the process level, because "restart" means
 * three different things here and the operator is choosing between them.
 *
 * Cloud-only entries (image upgrade, volume wipe, SurrealDB bounce) need the
 * control plane. They stay in the menu when it is not linked, muted, with the
 * reason, so the difference between "not offered" and "not available here" is
