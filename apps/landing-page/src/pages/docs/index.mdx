**Spooky** is a reactive, local-first application framework built on top of **SurrealDB**. It bridges the gap between the database and the client, allowing for "Incantations" (LIVE queries) that update incrementally and efficiently.

## Supported Frameworks

Spooky is designed to be framework-agnostic, with bindings and examples for popular platforms:

- **TypeScript / JavaScript** (Vanilla, React, SolidJS)
- **Flutter** (Mobile/Desktop)
- **Rust** (WASM Modules)

## Core Concepts

  <span>1. Syncgen</span>
</h3>

The build-time orchestrator that parses your schema and compiles your reactive modules. It ensures type safety and injects intelligent triggers for data synchronization.

  <span>2. Modules (DBSP)</span>
</h3>

Reactive engines running directly inside SurrealDB. They perform Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) to keep your queries updated efficiently without re-fetching entire datasets.

  <span>3. Incantations</span>
</h3>

The registry of active "Live Queries". Instead of subscribing to raw tables, clients subscribe to _Incantations_, which provide delta updates and integrity verification via Merkle Trees.
