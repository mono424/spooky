Querying data in Spooky is designed to be intuitive and reactive. The system handles the entire lifecycle of a query, from initialization to registration and liveness updates, ensuring your UI is always consistent with the database state.

## Query Lifecycle

1.  **Initialization**: When a component requests data, Spooky checks if a live query for that data already exists.
2.  **Registration**: If not, it registers a new query with the sync engine.
3.  **Liveness**: The query remains "live" as long as there are active subscribers. Spooky automatically manages subscriptions and unsubscription to optimize performance.

## Fluent Query API

The `db.query()` method provides a fluent interface to construct queries. It is fully typesafe based on your schema.

## Relationships

Spooky makes fetching related data incredibly simple with the `.related()` method. It automatically handles the underlying graph traversals or joins.

### Unified Query Syntax

Whether you are fetching a simple 1:1 link, a 1:N collection, or traversing a complex N:M graph, the syntax remains exactly the same. Spooky uses your schema definition to determine how to fetch the data.

<Note>
  **Magic behind the scenes:** You don't need to manually specify graph paths (e.g., `->liked->post`) or join conditions. Spooky inspects your `schema.surql` to understand that `liked` is a relation table connecting users to posts, and generates the correct query automatically.

## Type Safety

One of Spooky's strongest features is its end-to-end type safety.

When you use `.related()`, the return type of your query is automatically adjusted.

- **Without `.related()`**: The field is a `RecordId<"table">`.
- **With `.related()`**: The field becomes `Fetched<TableType>`.

<CodeBlock code={queryTypeSafetyCode} lang="typescript" />

This ensures you can never accidentally access a property on a relation that hasn't been fetched. TypeScript will catch the error at compile time.

## Using Hooks (SolidJS Example)

For reactive applications, Spooky provides hooks that automatically update your component when the data changes.
