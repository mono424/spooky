//! Admission control for job execution: how many of an outbox table's jobs may
//! be running at once, and what happens to the rest.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Pickup is CREATE-event-driven: a `CREATE` on an outbox table fires a DB event
//! that reaches [`crate::node::SspNode`], which used to push the job straight
//! onto a bounded in-memory channel. A wide fan-out therefore turned N rows into
//! N channel sends, and once the channel filled, the *ingest handler itself*
//! blocked — the DB-side `http::post` timed out and rows were only rescued a
//! minute later by the recovery sweep.
//!
//! So the queue moved to where the durable data already is. Above the limit,
//! nothing is queued in memory at all: the row simply stays `pending` in the
//! outbox and is admitted later, oldest first. The outbox *is* the queue. That
//! costs nothing extra to persist, survives a restart, and needs no new status
//! (`pending` already means "not yet picked up").
//!
//! # What a permit means
//!
//! A permit means **"this job is, or is about to be, `status = 'processing'`"** —
//! exactly the population the cluster count measures. It is acquired immediately
//! before the channel send and released when execution finishes.
//!
//! It is deliberately NOT tied to [`JobControl`]'s `enqueued` mark, even though
//! the two look interchangeable. That mark is a dedupe token with a much longer
//! life: it is held across the delay window in `route_pending_job` and across
//! retry backoff. Tying a permit to it would let one job with `delay: 1h` hold
//! the table's only slot for an hour, and would stop the runner from taking the
//! next job during a 200 ms backoff — something it does today.
//!
//! And it is an RAII guard rather than a `release()` call, because the runner
//! now executes jobs on spawned tasks: a panic inside one is isolated and would
//! skip any explicit release, permanently wedging a table whose limit is 1.
//!
//! # Scope of the limit
//!
//! Exact per process. In cluster mode the bound is best-effort across processes:
//! each drain counts non-stale `processing` rows and takes the tighter of the
//! local and global views. Two nodes draining in the same instant can overshoot
//! by up to one batch; they converge on the next pass. A single-node deployment
//! never runs the count and is exact.
