//! Query edge-update service (ported from `apps/ssp/src/edge_updates.rs`).
//!
//! The circuit emits a [`ViewDelta`] whenever a registered query's window
//! changes. Each delta's `_00_list_ref` edge writes are coalesced over a
//! window and flushed as ONE aggregated SurrealDB transaction.
//!
//! Portability note: the previous shell version bound the `_00_query`
//! incantation record id as a `surrealdb::RecordId` param (`$fromN`). The core
//! can't depend on the SDK, so the incantation now crosses the [`Db`] port as
//! a plain **string** key and the SQL wraps it in `type::record('_00_query',
//! $fromN)` — preserving the original bind safety (arbitrary keys) without a
//! RecordId. The `out`/`parent`/subquery record ids keep the existing literal
//! interpolation (they arrive already-validated from the circuit).
