# `@spooky-sync/ssp-wasm` — agent guide

## What this package is

The browser-side stream processor: a Rust crate compiled to WebAssembly via `wasm-pack` that runs the same DBSP-style materialized-view circuit as the Rust `apps/ssp` server, but inside the user's tab. `@spooky-sync/core` instantiates it under the hood to power local reactive queries — you almost never touch this package directly.

## When you might touch it

- You're debugging why a local query doesn't update after a mutation. `ingest()` is where new records land.
- You're testing the surrealism (embedded WASM) generation mode of `spky generate` and need to inspect the bundled circuit.
- You're saving/restoring local state across page loads outside the built-in snapshot path (`save_store_state` / `load_store_state`, with `reconcile` for the delta since).

## Public API (`pkg/ssp_wasm.d.ts`)

- **`class Sp00kyProcessor`** (constructed once, stored on the client):
  - `register_view(config: WasmViewConfig)` — register a materialized view by ID + SurQL + params.
  - `unregister_view(id)` — remove a view.
  - `ingest(table, op, id, record)` / `ingest_many(items)` — push row changes (`CREATE`/`UPDATE`/`MERGE`/`DELETE`); returns the affected views' deltas (`WasmViewUpdate[]`). Membership is presence-driven: the verb never double-counts or ghosts a row, and an unchanged write is a no-op.
  - `save_store_state()` / `load_store_state(bytes)` — snapshot/restore the base rows as bytes, under the registered views; `reconcile(table, [id, rv][])` steps in the delta against the durable store.
  - `set_projection(bool)` — keep only the fields registered plans evaluate per row; `register_view` reports `missing_fields` to widen with `MERGE`.
  - `compact()` / `dead_bytes()` / `live_bytes()` / `size_report()` — row-arena hygiene and memory attribution.
  - `save_state()` / `load_state(json)` — full circuit snapshot including views (server-shaped; the client uses the store-only pair).
  - `free()` / `[Symbol.dispose]` — release WASM memory.
- **`init()`** — must be called once after the WASM module loads.
- Types: `WasmViewConfig`, `WasmViewUpdate`, `WasmIngestItem`.

## Build

```bash
pnpm --filter @spooky-sync/ssp-wasm build   # wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg
```

Output is `pkg/`, which is the only directory shipped via `files`. The Rust source lives one level up in `packages/ssp/src/circuit/`.

## Pointers

- Server-side counterpart (same circuit, native build): `apps/ssp/`
- Sync engine that wires this in: `node_modules/@spooky-sync/core/AGENTS.md` → `src/modules/data/`
