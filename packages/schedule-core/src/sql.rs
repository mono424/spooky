//! Every SurrealQL statement the engine runs, in one place.
//!
//! Kept as constants (rather than inlined at the call sites) for the same
//! reason `PENDING_DUE_CLAUSE` is shared by both job-recovery sweeps: the
//! singlenode and cluster hosts must run byte-identical SQL or their behaviour
//! silently diverges. Tests assert on these strings directly.
//!
//! Three conventions run through all of it, the first two forced by how
//! SurrealDB coerces bound values:
//!
//! - **Never bind JSON `null`.** A `null` into an `option<T>` field is rejected
//!   ("Expected `none | string` but found `NULL`") — `option` means "T or NONE",
//!   and NULL is neither. So absent values are OMITTED from the bound object
//!   rather than nulled, which is why writes go through `CONTENT`/`MERGE` with
//!   an object built in Rust instead of a fixed `SET` list.
//! - **Datetimes must be cast in the statement.** A bound RFC 3339 string won't
//!   coerce into a `datetime` field, and a cast can't live inside a bound
//!   object, hence the `CONTENT object::extend($content, { at: <datetime>$x })`
//!   shape: non-datetime fields come from Rust, datetime fields are spliced in
//!   with their casts. Record links need the same treatment.
//! - **Record ids are always bound as a (table, key) PAIR.** The single-argument
//!   `type::record("_00_schedule:game-sync")` silently truncates at the hyphen
//!   and addresses `_00_schedule:game` instead, so every statement here uses the
//!   two-argument form.
//! - **Every state transition is guarded** by the status it expects to see, so a
//!   duplicate advancement pass, a late-completing killed job, or a second
//!   ticker can't overwrite a decision that was already made.
