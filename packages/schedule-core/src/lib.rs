//! Portable scheduling/workflow engine core.
//!
//! Two hosts embed this crate and share every line of engine logic:
//! - the singlenode SSP (`packages/ssp-node`, driven by `TimerKind::ScheduleSweep`)
//! - the cluster scheduler (`apps/scheduler`, driven by a tokio interval loop)
//!
//! The host provides two capabilities ([`ScheduleDb`], [`JobKill`]); everything
//! else — next-fire computation, tick claiming, fan-out, DAG advancement,
//! healing — lives here. The engine is the sole writer of the `_00_schedule*`
//! tables' engine-owned fields and NEVER writes outbox job `status` (the
//! `JobRunner` stays the single status writer).
//!
//! wasm wrinkle: same `MaybeSendSync` / `async_trait(?Send)` split as
//! `ssp-node::ports` so a future wasm shell can link the crate.
