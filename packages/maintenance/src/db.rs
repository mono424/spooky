/// The HTTP engine is only *nominally* stateless. On connect it sends an RPC

/// SurrealDB restarts, that map is empty again, so every request from a
/// previously-connected handle fails with `Session not found: <uuid>` — forever.
///
/// Re-running `signin` on the same handle cannot recover it: the signin is
/// itself routed through the dead session UUID and fails the same way. That is
/// exactly what a plain `spawn_periodic_resignin` loop used to do, so a single
/// SurrealDB restart left the SSP and scheduler permanently unable to reach the
/// database — no job drain, no view registration, no realtime — until their own
/// containers were restarted.
///
/// `ReconnectingDb` closes that hole: the periodic tick probes the current
/// handle and, when the probe says the session is dead, builds a *brand-new*
