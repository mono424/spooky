//! Memory-footprint baseline for the circuit.
//!
//! The SSP holds every syncable table in RAM for the whole process lifetime,
//! so its resident size is what decides whether a tenant fits under its cgroup
//! cap. These tests pin the current cost per row and per registered query so a
//! representation change has to *prove* its reduction, and so a regression that
//! quietly inflates the store fails CI instead of arriving as an OOM kill in
//! production (which leaves no log line — the container is simply SIGKILLed).
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d: they allocate hundreds of MB and take seconds. Run explicitly:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test -p ssp --release --test memory_profile -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! **These thresholds are meant to be ratcheted DOWN.** Each phase of the
//! zero-copy row-store work should lower them and leave the new number here as
//! its evidence. Never raise one to make a build pass: a raise means the change
//! made the store bigger, which is the thing this file exists to catch.
